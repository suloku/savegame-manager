# NDSEventTool - Nintendo DS Mystery Event Distributor

This is based on nds-savegame-manager, a NDS homebrew tool by Pokedoc to rip and restore saves from DS and GBA games.

This modification works with Pok√©mon GBA games and allows to inject official Nintendo Events to the savegames in the cartridge.

Please, consider making a backup with the standard homebrew by Pokedoc (https://code.google.com/p/savegame-manager/).
